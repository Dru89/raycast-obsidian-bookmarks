- [ ] Re-write a few things to use React Context
  - Applications: `useApplications`, `useApplication`
  - Preferences: `usePreferences`, `usePreference`
  - Files: `useFiles`, `useFile`, `useLazyFile`. (Should offer easier ICRUD; lazy will wait to read from disk if it can.)
- [ ] Re-write local storage cache fetch
  - Add an `mtime` to the cache. Can use this to compare to see if we need a read.
  - Use streamed updates instead of a promise with RxJS.
- [ ] create an icon
  - https://github.com/raycast/extensions/tree/main/extensions/obsidian + a bookmark symbol?
- [ ] Get some screenshots
- [ ] Update CHANGELOG.md and README.md
- [ ] Follow along with: https://developers.raycast.com/basics/prepare-an-extension-for-store
